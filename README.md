# Java Kihon

This project is just a small example to show how it looks like a basic
spring boot + spring mvc + hibernate application.

## How to run

To run the server, from the root folder, just use the command `./gradlew bootRun.

To make sure that everything is working fine just access the following url
`http://localhost:8080/greeting/1`. That should lead you to a hello world page
for the person with id 1.
